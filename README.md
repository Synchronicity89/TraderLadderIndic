# TraderLadder
Current version: 0.3.3

Free SuperDOM Ladder for Order Flow traders on Ninjatrader.

TraderLadder is a free order flow ladder for Ninjatrader v8. The SuperDOM column can display the following:

- Last trades
- Buys / Sells in a configurable sliding time window (defaults to 60 seconds) + Imbalance detection
- Last prints or Largest prints at price in sliding window _**(New in v0.3.3)**_
- Session Buys / Sells + Imbalance detection
- Bid/Ask + Bid/Ask updates
- Bid/Ask historgram _**(New in v0.3.3)**_
- Volume histogram
- If in a position, Current P/L + Session P/L + Account cash value

## Disclaimer
This software is provided for free, including the source code for it. At some point, Ninjatrader will (fingers-crossed) provide an OrderFlow DOM of their own. Until then, hopefully this can help fill in the gap - in the free software domain :)
